# Fretboard roadmap

DONE - Offset functionality.
	- table padding
- Left-handed display.
- Audio hookup.
	- Base tuning per string (440hz relative?)
- Ability to add strings

What are the things that I want out of a fretboard tool?

- Set octave
- "blind mode" - don't show notes
- fret quiz
	- "is note X on fret Y?"
	- "find X note on Y string"
	- "How many naturals are on X fret?"/"How many sharps/flats are on X string?"
	- "How many notes in X key are on Y fret?"
	- "Name the notes on fret X in ascending order/descending order"
- Filter notes
	- key configuration for display and quiz
	- Scale configuration
	- Arpeggio configuration
- Display sharps only/flats only based on key
	- Enharmonic key support (double flats, double sharps?)
