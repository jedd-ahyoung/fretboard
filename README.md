# Metronome

A quick and dirty metronome - nothing fancy, just solid timekeeping. Metronome goes all the way down to 2 bpm with accuracy.

## Roadmap

- Changing tempo over time
- Saving tempo and volume settings to localstorage

- Tap tempo

- Support for different sounds
- Time signature/first beat support
- Subdivision support
- Visual metronome functionality
- Tempo name display (allegro, andante, etc.)
